# Item Price Prediction Using NLP

Co-authored by Alex Jorenby and Jiehwan Yang

When a seller inputs AN item's information (category name, brand name, item condition, shipping, and item description), Mercari wants to suggest an ideal selling price so that the seller can make more informed decisions with setting a price for each item.

To solve this problem, we used natural language processing (NLP) techniques on the item descriptions (145 characters on average per item) and used regression algorithms to predict the itemâ€™s price.

We utilized Docker and Git to collaborate.

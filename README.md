# Price_Prdiction_Using_NLP

Co-authored by Alex Jorenby and Jiehwan Yang

When the seller inputs item's information (category name, brand name, item condition, shipping, and item description), Mercari suggests a selling price to the sellers so that they can set ideal pricing tags for each item.

To solve this problem, we used natural language processing (NLP) techniques on the item descriptions and used regression algorithms to predict the itemâ€™s price.

We utilized Docker and Git to collaborate.
